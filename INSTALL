# Pre-Requisite

Create the folder to use with it :
$ mkdir /usr/share/poppac

Give right to your monitoring user on it (shinken OR nagios OR icinga...)
$ chown shinken /usr/share/poppac

++EASY WAY :
Just get the "perl-dep.tar" archive in the main repository
than unpack all files and folders inside you main perl folder

Ubuntu/debian:
$ cp -rf perl-dep/* /usr/share/perl/5.18.2/

>> You can skip to # INSTALL # if you choose EASY WAY

--MANUAL WAY:
You'll need those perl module
$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Encoding::BER'
$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Convert::BER'

If you are running CPAN for the first time, answer to question by pressing ENTER for default values.

If it ask again for the BER module after a successfull install,
got this error under Ubuntu Trusty
$ cd /usr/local/share/perl/"version"/Convert
$ cp * ../
$ cd ../Encoding
$ cp -f BER.pm ../
$ cp BER/* ../

You should have BER.pm and SNMP.pm inside /usr/local/share/perl/"version"/

You also need SNMP_Session module
$ wget https://snmp-session.googlecode.com/files/SNMP_Session-1.13.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf â€¦
$ perl Makefile.pm
$ make & make install


# INSTALL #

At the moment, it's manual: 
1. Downlaod the script .pl 
2. place it inside your "libexec" folder 
3. gives your nagios/shinken user rights on it 
4. Create a new template and service definition for your monitoring system 
5. into the "commands.cfg", call the script for each type of paper you want to check, just change the OID and add $HOSTADDRESS$ as 2nd argument.
6. link some hosts to this template
